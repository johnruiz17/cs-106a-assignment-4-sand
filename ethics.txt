Reflective Ethics Question


a. What simplifying and idealizing assumptions did we ask you to make when working on the Sand portion
of this assignment? How did different components of the "real-world system" we were representing get mapped
to different computational representations?

The simulation of gravity was simplified for the purposes of this assignment. In real life, gravity has an
acceleration value of -9.8 meters per second squared, and so the velocity at which an object descends when it
is falling increases every second. In the sand world, gravity was simulated as having a consistent rate at which
it caused sand to move down. This real-world-system of objects falling due to the force of gravity was simulated by the
do_gravity() function which caused every pixel that contained sand to move down if doing so was a valid move.


b. What considerations should computer scientists keep in mind when designing computer simulations?
What should the programmers of simulations communicate about the idealizing assumptions they made
to allow others to understand and evaluate them?

Computer scientists should keep in mind the potential for representational harms when designing computer simulations.
For example, a virtual reality game that represents virtual characters of color in a way that perpetuates negative
stereotypes would be an example of a representational harm brought about by programmers not taking the time to take
into account the ethical considerations of their software in the pre-deployment phase. When it comes to a program that
simulates the natural world through certain assumptions and simplifications, programmers should make sure to communicate
these assumptions and simplification in accompanying files with their program, or with appropriately
placed asterisked disclaimers either on their official site or at the bottom of advertisements.
